# Real-Time Network Visualization and Packet Analysis Tool

A powerful, currently tested on **Linux** (planned support for Windows & macOS) network packet analysis tool built using **Qt (C++)** with a **Flask-based backend** for extended processing. The project focuses on deep packet inspection, real-time network visualization, traceroute mapping, and anomaly detection using machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 **1. Packet Sniffing & Analysis (C++)**

* Captures network packets in real time.
* Supports multiple protocols: **TCP, UDP, ICMP**, and more.
* Automatic detection and logging of **TCP handshakes** (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK).
* Uniform JSON export of packet data (every fixed interval / batch).
* Built with raw sockets / pcap (depending on OS).

### 🌐 **2. Flask Server for Packet Processing (Python)**

* Receives packet data from the Qt client in JSON format.

* Performs:
  ✔ Packet classification
  ✔ Header extraction
  ✔ Content-based analysis

* Sends structured results back to the Qt GUI.

### 🤖 **3. Anomaly Detection (Random Forests)**

* Detects suspicious patterns such as:

  * Abnormal packet bursts
  * Unusual port activity
  * Strange IP behavior
  * Protocol anomalies
* Model trained using scikit-learn.
* Results displayed in the UI with alerts.

### 🧭 **4. Traceroute Mapping**

* Performs IP-level route discovery.
* Visualizes the path each packet takes across the network.
* Helps identify routing issues and network hops.

### 📊 **5. Visualization Dashboard (Qt)**

* **Network Graph View**

  * Displays devices as nodes.
  * Shows connections as edges.

* **Line Graph View and Tabular View**

  * Real-time packet rate monitoring.
  * Bandwidth / protocol usage.
  * Full packet breakdown.
  * Live updates from backend.

* **Anomaly Detection View**

  * Analyzes each packet and queries the server to check if it is malicious.
  * Displays the AI model’s Random Forest output in a structured tabular format.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system operates through a clean multi-stage pipeline, separating packet capture, analysis, backend processing, and frontend visualization.

### **System Flow**

1. **Packet Sniffer (Pure C++)**

   * Uses Linux's native networking capabilities.
   * Accesses raw network traffic via libraries like **libpcap**.
   * Preprocesses & structures packet data.

2. **Communication to Flask Backend**

   * Packet sniffer sends JSON payloads directly to the Flask server.
   * Flask acts as a lightweight processing layer.

3. **Flask Server → Qt Application**

   * Flask exposes a REST API.
   * The Qt client polls these endpoints for real-time updates.

4. **Qt Visualization Layer**

   * Polling-based refresh for graphs, tables, and alerts.

## 🧠 Additional Notes

* Currently confirmed working on ** Linux**. Windows & macOS testing is planned..
* Designed to be modular: sniffer, analysis engine, and ML components can be swapped independently.
* Emphasis on real-time visualization and clarity.
